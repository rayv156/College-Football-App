This app was created to showcase pulling API info, jQuery, JavaSript, CSS, and HTML.  I decided to create an app that had all my relevant college football matchup information in one spot.  I generally look through multipile sources to gather my information when keeping up with college football so I though a personalized site would be useful.  I used a college football database and called several urls to pull all the data to start the app off.  I wanted a compare feature to look at each team side by side so I added a view matchup button to the first team that is originally searched.  I also wanted some tangible information to compare to I added links to the 247 sports page for each recruiting class and the metrics section to dive into the details.  In order to add the second team, I created a second div and adjusted the width of the first div to 50%.  I also added a close button on the compare team so the user can go back to 100% of the screen for their original team if they wanted.  To get started, search for your team and whichever year you're interested in.  This will show the team's information and allow the user to start comparing.  I have not added any code to make the search a little more user friendly but plan on making that change.
